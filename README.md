# Text Call

Text Call is an innovative communication app that combines the urgency of a phone call with the convenience of text messaging. With Text Call, you can send important messages to your contacts without the need for a live conversation.

## Features

- **Text Call**: Initiate a call to someone, and when they answer, they'll see a pre-written message from you instead of engaging in a conversation.
- **Future Plans**: Visit the [Roadmap](#roadmap) section to learn about planned features and enhancements.
